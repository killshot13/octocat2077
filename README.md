### About <a name = "about"></a>

- Features a snazzy Windows Terminal color scheme with a complementary background image.

- The choice of imagery for the background draws inspiration from the beloved octocat logo popularized by GitHub.

- The color scheme is based on the recently released CyberPunk 2077 video game.

- Hence the name `OCTOCAT 2077`. Take a look!

- Use the values from the `settings.json` file as applicable to customize your existing `bash.exe` profile in Windows Terminal.

- If none yet exists because you have just installed Git Bash, copy and paste directly beneath the system-generated profiles in the `settings.json` of your Windows Terminal.

- Don't forget to take note of where you store the background image and update the path assigned to `"backgroundImage"`.
